# ffmpeg-normalize-extras

This repo provides some extra scripts for using [ffmpeg-normalize](https://github.com/slhck/ffmpeg-normalize/).

The scripts are:
- `manual.sh` - A script to manually process a file with `ffmpeg-normalize`, using a static temp dir.
- `sickbeard_mp4_automator-postprocess.sh` - A [sickbeard_mp4_automator](https://github.com/mdhiggins/sickbeard_mp4_automator) post-process script to call ffmpeg-normalize on the output file(s).

## Contributions

Feel free to submit a PR for a post-process script for other tools that don't already exist in this repo. Please try to keep them simple and short. Thanks!
